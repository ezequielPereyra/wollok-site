This version is a tribute to [Hypatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia), a Hellenistic Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician.

Wollok 1.8 release is available, with so many features!

- **type system inference** is already active when you launch Wollok for the very first time! You'll be able to get type information for variables, parameters, and detect earlier programming errors
- [wollok-cli](https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok-cli), a new project is born, allowing you to have [**Travis continuous integration**](../documentacion/apuntes#integracion-con-travis) in your Wollok projects. Tasks automation is easier now, give a try!
- enhanced **dynamic diagram** integrated with REPL console, a didactic tool for teaching OOP
- better UX for REPL console, less resource-consuming. You can also **import any file of your project in the console**. If you want to get a deeper view, please take a look to the [tour](../tour) page
- [**named parameters**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11c9l3sqgUIFDx1J_ULCSS86faMQXAyOV3uesg-nwaSY/edit#heading=h.vj2ax6a4f7xh) is now the preferred and default way for object instantiation
- error reporting is more flexible now, which fosters the user to explore the language in an iterative way
- smart autocomplete functionality, filtering private messages and prioritizing them
- optimization for performance in Wollok lists and sets!
- adding new methods in Wollok library objects (days of week, better `toString` definition for pairs and dates, `left(), right(), reverse()` in String, `copyWith(), copyWithout()` in Collection, etc.). Also null parameters are catched, for a better error detection in your programs.
- Stack trace copy and overall time elapsed in Test Runner
- and new quick fixes were added!

## New "wollokers"!

Since july, two hackatons were made: [chinese-food](https://twitter.com/wollokLang/status/1150785337108680704) the first and [empanadas](https://twitter.com/wollokLang/status/1156572239241863169) the second. A lot of students from Universidad Nacional de San Mart√≠n and Universidad Nacional de Quilmes attended the meeting, joined the team, and they are currently working to improve our product day by day.

[We are looking for you!](../comunidad)!
