3.0.0 version is a tribute to [Juana Azurduy](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juana_Azurduy), marshal of Alto Peru, great leadership of the independence for both Argentina and Bolivia.

There's also an upgrade for the [wollok-cli](https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok-cli) tool, version 3.2.0. You can work with your preferred CI workflow, such as Github Actions.

- a new set of icons was chosen, taking into account visually impaired people and enhancing user experience

- a clearer icon and a warning on the REPL console whenever you work without an associated file:

![consola REPL sin archivo](/images/news/jazurduy_console_en.gif)

Remember that you can always restart REPL console from scratch, or rerun last session commands as shown in our [Wollok tour](../tour).

- you can also work with **dark mode** theme, easily configured following instructions in [tour](../tour) page.

- **new simplified syntax for object instantiation and mixin linearization** (check out our documentation)

- enhancements made for Wollok Game will help you to create awesome games!

- constructors were deleted, favoring only named parameters + initialize method also for _describes_ (replacing fixtures)

You can check solved issues [here](https://github.com/uqbar-project/wollok/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
